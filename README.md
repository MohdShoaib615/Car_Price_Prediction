# Car_Price_Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car given its specifications. The project showcases the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.



**Project Highlights**

--> **Data Collection:** We've gathered a comprehensive dataset of car listings, ensuring a diverse range of makes, models, and attributes.

--> **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is meticulously cleaned, handling missing values and outliers, and prepared for analysis.

--> **Feature Selection:** Through thorough analysis and feature importance techniques, we've identified the most influential features for predicting car prices.

--> **Model Selection:** We explore multiple regression algorithms, comparing their performance to select the best-performing model.

--> **Model Evaluation:** The chosen model is evaluated using relevant metrics, ensuring its accuracy and robustness


**CONCLUSION:-** 
    
Using the Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning algorithms I have achieved a good predicting model with RandomForestRegressor.
